        <h3> 1- "What even is landsat?" </h3>
        <p> Landsat is an Earth observation satellite program managed by NASA and USGS, 
          whose aim is to monitor the Earth and keep a record of its images to better understand 
          how the surface and natural resources of our planet work and change.</p>
      
          <hr>


        <h3> 2- "How long has been the Landsat program running for?" </h3>
        <p> The Landsat program has been running for more than half a century, since the Earth
           Resources Technology Satellite, which was later renamed to Landsat 1, has launched in
            1972. Since then, the program has gathered more than 8 million images.</p>
      
            <hr>

        <h3> 3- "Why is the Landsat program important?" </h3>
        <p> The Landsat program is important because it helps us gather immense knowledge about how our 
          planet has changed over the last decades. It also gives us the information we need to better 
          manage the Earth’s natural resources.</p>

          <h3> 4- "What is your mission?" </h3>
          <p>
            Our mission is to make a web-app which provides a person to view the 
            landsat reflectance data with a map which can be monitored through our site
          </p>

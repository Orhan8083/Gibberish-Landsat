        <h2> Brief Explanation of the Landsat Project</h2>
        <p>
          The surface of the Earth has been changing since it has formed. As humans, we want to understand and know how things <br>
          work so that we can use it to our advantage, and this is no exception. One of the latest ways we monitor and keep record <br>
          of how the world’s surface and environment change is by satellites. And in particular by a satellite imagery program <br>
          called Landsat. Landsat is a remote sensing  Earth observation program made possible by the cooperation of NASA and <br>
          the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The satellite program monitors our world and is a comprehensive source of <br>
          earth’s imagery. The program consists of multiple satellites, first of which was launched in 1972, 7 years after the then <br>
          director of USGS, William T. Pecora, first proposed the idea. The project was aimed to collect knowledge about world’s <br>
          natural resources. The program was firstly called Earth Resources Satellites Program, before being renamed Landsat.<br> 									
          Landsat 1, which was then called ERTS-A and ERTS-1, had been in duty for 5 years when the mission was terminated <br>
          in 1978. Landsat 2 and 3, which were nearly identical copies of Landsat 1, were launched in 1975 and 1978 espectively. <br>
          All three of the satellites were each equipped with a Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and a Multispectral <br>
          Scanner (MSS). Then Landsat 4, carrying a Thematic Mapper and an updated version of MSS, was launched <br>
          in 1982 and it operated until 1993. Landsat 5, an almost identical copy of its predecessor, operated <br>
          from 1984 to 2013. This makes it the longest Earth-observing satellite mission in history. Landsat 6 <br>
          had an unsuccesful launch and it failed to reach orbit. The last three satellites that were <br>
          launched were equipped with sensors that worked to increase the volume of Earth observation data:<br>
          Landsat 7 in 1999, Landsat 8 in 2013 and Landsat 9 in 2021. Landsat 8 and 9 are currently active and<br>
          they are taking pictures of all parts of the Earth every 16 days.</p>
        </p>

          The Landsat satellites are crucial for understanding our planet’s ecology because with <br>
          them, we have acces to an unbroken chain of images of Earth’s surface through the years. <br>
          How we decide to use Earth’s resources is reflected on its weather, climate change, <br>
          ecosystems, global and national economy, human health and society. Landsat program plays <br>
          a major role in examining, understanding and therefore easily managing the land resources<br>
          humankinds needs. Earth observing satellites has helped us learn about our home planet’s <br>
          terrain, including crop fields and sprawling cities, forests and shrinking glaciers.<br>
          Having gathered and archived more than 8 million images since the launch of the first <br>
          Landsat satellite in 1972, the program is one of the most valuable sources of information <br>
          concerning our planet’s landscape. This collection of Landsat images, which is publicly <br>
          avaliable and free, has led to important scientific discoveries and <br>
          more informed resource management.	<br>
          <br>
          The top 16 applications of Landsat imagery produced savings of approximately 350 million dollars each year  <br>
          for federal and state governments, NGO's, and the private sector, as reported by the Landsat Advisory <br>
           Group of the National Geospatial Advisory Committee in 2015. The top 16 applications of Landsat images are: <br>
           <br>
          1. U.S. Department of Agriculture risk management <br>
          2. U.S. Government mapping <br>
          3. Agricultural water use monitoring <br>
          4. Global security monitoring <br>
          5. Support for fire management <br>
          6. Detection of forest fragmentation <br>
          7. Detection of forest change <br>
          8. World agriculture supply and demand estimates <br>
          9. Vineyard management and water conservation <br>
          10. Flood mitigation mapping <br>
          11. Agricultural commodities mapping <br>
          12. Waterfowl habitat mapping and monitoring <br>
          13. Coastal change analysis <br> 
          14. Forest health monitoring <br>
          15. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency global shoreline mapping <br>
          16. Wildfire risk assessment [26] <br>
          <br>
          Further uses of Landsat imagery include, but are not limited to: fisheries, <br>
          forestry, shrinking inland water bodies, fire damage, glacier retreat, urban <br>
          development, and discovery of new species. Landsat satellites have the power <br>
          to efficiently track land usage and to document land change due to climate <br>
          change, urbanization, drought, wildfire, biomass changes (carbon assessments), <br>
          and a host of other natural and human-caused changes. <br>
          The Landsat program offers a vast array of information about the climate change.<br> 
          For example, in 2017, Landsat 8 has been able to monitor, via the Thermal <br>
          Infrared Sensor, the temperature changes in the ice when a chunk about the size of<br> 
          Delaware broke loose from the Antarctic Peninsula,using the Thermal Infrared Sensor. <br>
          In the false colored picture below to the right, white and light blue parts are the <br>
          lowest temperatures while yellow and red are the highest. The Thermal Infrared Sensors <br>
          onboard Landsat 8 and 9 also help scientists track agricultural water use via detecting <br>
          the cooler temperature caused by watered soil, one of the many ways Landsat helps agriculture.<br>

          Kansas, taken by the Landsat 7 satellite.<br>

        <p>
          One of the many things Landsat documents is how the forests of our planet have changed over the decades. <br>
          People can see how different factors such as climate change, industrialization and deforestation have <br>
          contributed to changing our planet’s landscape. The satellites are also capable of keeping track of forest<br>
           fires and giving the authorities necessary information about how a fire is spreading. These are valuable <br>
           pieces of knowledge considering how much of its greenness the Earth has lost over the last century. We can <br>
           look to Landsat to investigate how our world has changed in the last half a century. The top right picture is the Landsat<br>
            images of burned land in Yellowstone National Park in 1989 and 2011.<br>
        </p>


        <p>
          Environmental disasters can also be investigated through Landsat data. Matters such as wildfires, glacier retreat, <br>
          shrinking water bodies and unplanned urbanization can be tracked by Landsat. For example, the shrinking of the Aral <br>
          Sea, whic has been called "One of the planet's worst environmental disasters", has been documented thoroughly by <br>
          Landsat program. Landsat imagery is a great way to communicate with and inform the public about the state of our <br>
          planet. This is because visual images have more power over people than just words. Bottom right is a Landsat image Aral <br>
          Sea in 2013.<br>

        <h2> Our Goals</h2>
        <p>
          The Landsat files are already avaliable at NASA's and  United States Geological Surveys Websites.<br>
          Even though these files are publicly available, it can be dificult for a person to download, view,<br>
          analyze and monitor the data. Our mission is to make a web-app which provides a person to view the <br>
          landsat reflectance data with a map which can be monitored through our site without downloading the file<br>
          or deal with any KML files which may sound gibberish at first glance.<br>
          <br>
          So, we made a site using various markup and scripting languages which includes; HTML, CSS, JavaScript and<br>
          GeoJSON. If you are curious, we recommend you to view our Github page, our source code is available to the<br>
          public.

        <h2> How Does The Site Work </h2>
        <p>
        The design of the site was made using simple HTML and CSS markup languages. We used the Visual Studio <br>
        Code IDE for editing the code. We also made a simple and user friendly design which includes tabs that <br>
        can be used to travel easily across the site. The site tabs are made using the “href” function in HTML. <br> 
        The Map was the major part of our project, which most of our labour went to. First we had to get the <br>
        NASA Landsat data and grid sheets. So we headed over to NASA's site to download the “.KML” files. One<br>
        “.KML” file slices the earth to grids, and the other one shows the centres, the centres are used to <br>
        give information and coordinates of the selected places.<br>
        <br>
        After downloading the required files, we had to find a basemap for the grids to sit on.<br>
        OpenStreetMap is a project which aims to provide a world map that is free to use and open <br>
        to the public. We used LeafletJS, an open source project that makes embedding OpenStreetMap<br>
        Maps to HTML pages possible. After putting the Map onto our site via LeafletJS, all that <br>
        was left was putting the grids to the world map. <br>
        <br>
        In order to display the grids, first we needed to convert the “.KML” files to GeoJSON files.<br> 
        We first need to explain JSON (Java Script Object Notation) to explain GeoJSON. JSON is an open <br>
        standard format which was derived from JavaScript, though nowadays it is readable by many modern<br>
         programming languages, it uses human readable text to store and transmit data objects. GeoJSON <br>
        is a variant of JSON which is made to store primarily geographical information. After converting<br>
        the “.KML” files to GeoJSON files, we had to connect the geographical values to our map which <br>
        primarily runs on JavaScript.<br>
        <br>
        JavaScript is a scripting language and it is the literal beating heart of the web. It is called a <br>
        scripting language and not a programming language because it was made specifically to run on the <br>
        web. There is a famous saying by Jeff Atwood, an American programmer, which goes; “If something <br>
        can be written in JavaScript, it will eventually be written in JavaScript.” I think you get the <br>
        idea of where this is going, we needed to create a variable that extracts data from the GeoJSON <br>
        and then be used in JavaScript. So we made a JavaScript file with the same GeoJSON data and <br>
        using the “var … =” function we were able to create a variable that can be used on our site <br>
        via JavaScript. <br>
        <br>
        At first glance, it seems like we were done, but we had to do one last thing. Because the NASA <br>
        file is so large compared to other GeoJSON files, we had to create a tilelayer to the top of our <br>
        map to prevent any glitches. In order to do that, there is a simple plugin on LeafletJS, which’s <br>
        source code is available to the public. It is again a javascript file, which can be attached to <br>
        the HTML document. That way, the tile layer and the map were separated and worked without any glitches.<br>
